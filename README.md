____________

1. Convert Thoughts Into Actions

        1.1 Tag Thoughts.
        1.2 Validated Tags Into Actions through monitor check.
        1.3 Once Validated Then Use Tag For Distraction as injection of error(IoE) method.
        1.4 IoE is validated through distractions confirmation.
        1.5 Revalidate tag for new changes.
        1.6 100% coverage.

Approval Note:

    Waited for 4 years to get approval from 1 God that if creating mind control devices is sin or not the sin.

    No response therefore I am going to take it as yes [1,2,3,4,5] from 1 God and 
    I should not be judge on judgement day about it since I sacrifice my 4 years just to get ack.

    Witness Page On Judgement that I requested permission from 1 God.

    No response from 1 God, I will take it as Approved for me since I followed the right path 
    from intention level-1 to Picked the Choice level-4.

    1. Intention
    2. Select from Choice Menu 
    3. Menu of Choices 
    4. Picked the Choice 
    5. Action (Innovation of sensors of selected choice). 
    6. Freedom. 
    7. Freedom of Speech [Share with World in form of documentation].
